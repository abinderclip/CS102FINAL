This GUI uses a BMI Calculator API to output a person's Body Mass Index after 
they enter their height and weight. \url{https://market.mashape.com/nviror/bmi-calculator}
It also tells them whether they are underweight or overweight and what potential health risks they could face.
Depending on their BMI, the GUI will output a helpful infographic with exercise and diet tips.

\normalpage{Specification}{%
This GUI uses an API to calculate a person’s Body Mass Index after they 
enter their height and weight. It also tells them whether they are 
underweight or overweight and about potential risks they could face. 
Depending on the output, the GUI will open a window that shows celebrities 
who are in the same BMI range as the user and helpful health tips.

\normalpage{Analysis}{%
We will use the mashape marketplace to acquire an API that calculates the user's BMI. 
(https://market.mashape.com/nviror/bmi-calculator) 
Users input their measurements in the appropriate search box (pounds 
for weight and inches for height). The information is returned in json 
format. We are going to use this API to parse it: https://github.com/nlohmann/json. 
Once we find the url from that info, we can use the CURL API to retrieve the user’s BMI. 
https://curl.haxx.de. The BMI will be displayed on a new window with two buttons, {\bf Health Tips} 
and {\bf Celebs with Similar BMIs}. The first option will open a window with 
a helpful infographic. The second will open a new window with celebrities who 
are in the same BMI range as the user.

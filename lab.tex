\normalpage{Specification}{%
This API outputs a personâ€™s Body Mass Index after they enter their height and weight. It also tells them whether they are underweight or overweight and about potential risks they could face. Depending on the output, the GUI will output a helpful infographic with exercise and diet tips.
}
\normalpage{Analysis}{%
We will use the mashape marketplace to query for a gif matching the keyword.
\url{https://market.mashape.com/giphy/giphy} The information is returned
in json format. Initially, we were going to use this API to parse it: \url{https://github.com/nlohmann/json}. Unforutnately,
our json was not working so we used a c string to parse through the information instead.
Once we find the url from that info, we cas use the CURL API to retrieve the gif.
\url{https://curl.haxx.de}

My code works like 15 percent of the time. The gif is found and downloaded, but it is not displayed.
Sometime it is displayed, sometime it is not. The gif is not animated.
